# rock_paper_scissors

This is a challenge from The Odin Project to create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game from scratch using JavaScript.

The main difficulty I had creating this was that I had a break between the learning and completing this challenge, meaning I'd forgotten some of the syntax.  I solved this by going back through the appropriate lessons.

In future I want to update this to - 

- Add a UI (at the moment the game only runs in the console)
- Add validation to ensure the user can only make a valid selection
- Optimise the five-game round with a loop
- Improve the formatting of this README file with markdown
